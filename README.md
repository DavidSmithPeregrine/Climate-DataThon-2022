# Git repo for all of the work done for the Climate Datathon 2022
### Much of this work was finding open source datasets and aggregating them for visualization

## Folders
### The map visualizations folder contains the HTML for the 2d map as well as the python notebook for data processing
Many of the other folders contain data and processing notebooks for that data
